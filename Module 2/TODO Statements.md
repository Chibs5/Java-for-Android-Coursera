**TODO Statements/TODO Comments** exist to help a programmer create a list of tasks that require additional attention.
 This is useful in maintaining projects especially when the project size grows beyond a small simple app, or when multiple people are working on the same project
 
 These TODO comments exist to allow developers to leave easily traceable and findable comments within the source code that indicate further action is required 
 in that location.
